# Formal-Verification

This program was written as part of a course on formal verification. The course teaches Propositional logic, First-Order Logic and Hoare Logic. These logic systems are then applied to computer programs to prove that they are free from errors and terminating. I implemented these proofs using Dafny. Dafny is an imperative compiled language that targets C# and supports formal specification through preconditions, postconditions, loop invariants and loop variants. The course improved my programming by helping to show me what conditions are necessary to guarantee bug-free terminating code, I have included an example of one of the assignments we completed in this repo. I achieved the highest possible grade in the class.
